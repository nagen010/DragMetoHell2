# DragMetoHell2

simple iOS game

Upon start-up, randomly selected cells (about 20% of all cells) filled with various images.

When the user clicks and drags on the angel's image, cells with other images must be avoided.

If one of the other image's cells is entered, that image blows up to twice its original size, then returns to its original size. After this blow-up, the angel image is reduced to half it's current size.

If the angel drops below 1/8 of its original size, the game is lost.

If the angel arrives at the bottom right cell, the grid background turns a lurid red, and a devil image snaps to the center of that cell, and the game is won.
